Small technology start-up who have just launched their platform aimed at disrupting the car insurance market.

There are two positions available for Senior Java developers (ideally with a keen interest in DevOps and Continuous Delivery). Immediate responsibilities will be around the creation of API’s that enable the platform to plug into major price comparison websites and then to help scale and improve the platform to cope with the immediate increase in throughput.  

# Project examples: 

-Lots of greenfield development to be done with some interesting challenges around design of an event driven architecture.
-Helping the team achieve their goal of continuous delivery they are about 80% of the way there with just the hard bits left to deliver according to the CTO.
