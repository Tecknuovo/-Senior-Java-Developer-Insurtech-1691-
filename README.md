# The company: 
Small technology start-up who have just launched their platform aimed at disrupting the car insurance market. Product is one month old with a handful of active users and the next stage is to plug into one of the major price comparison sites which will bring immediate challenges in terms of scalability and resilience. 

# The environment/Culture: 
Based in a shared office space near East Aldgate the entire company currently fits in one room and is largely technical. Smalll but surprisingly diverse development team lead by a hands on CTO who I have previously described as one of the nicest guys in tech.  

# The role: 
There are two positions available for Senior Java developers (ideally with a keen interest in DevOps and Continuous Delivery). Immediate responsibilities will be around the creation of API’s that enable the platform to plug into major price comparison websites and then to help scale and improve the platform to cope with the immediate increase in throughput.  

# Project examples: 

 -  Lots of greenfield development to be done with some interesting challenges around design of an event driven architecture.
 -  Helping the team achieve their goal of continuous delivery they are about 80% of the way there with just the hard bits left to deliver according to the CTO. 
 -  The chance to do some full stack development work with a bit of JavaScript if you are interested in that aspect. 
  -  Working on problems at scale.
